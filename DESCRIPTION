Description:  Developing a prediction model on the annotation of chemicals in human blood can provide new insight into 
    the distribution and extent of exposures to a wide range of chemicals in humans. Our objective of this module is 
    to develop a machine learning model (eg., random forest) to predict blood concentrations of chemicals and prioritize 
    chemicals of health concern.
